This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover trends in patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance. The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of these metrics, covering both inbound patients (admitted to the hospital) and outbound patients (visiting doctors without admission), enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

**Data Integration:** Consolidated various healthcare datasets, including both inbound and outbound patient data, into a single, cohesive data model using Power Query. Implemented data cleaning and transformation processes to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

**Advanced DAX Calculations:** Developed dynamic measures and calculated columns to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) related to patient outcomes, resource utilization, and operational efficiency.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Designed a series of dashboards with interactive visual elements, such as heatmaps, line charts, and bar graphs, to present insights into patient satisfaction, readmission rates, and more. Included options to drill down into data based on patient type (inbound vs. outbound), regions, and time periods.

**Performance Insights:** Conducted in-depth analysis to identify trends and patterns in healthcare data, providing actionable insights that can be used to improve patient care and optimize hospital operations.![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3cd24cf-34ff-4897-8482-0513a21cbcf4)
